## Data Collection
- Run `node check_manifest.js` to check if a potential pwa contains a manifest.
- Run `fetch_manifest.js` to fetch the manifest of a pwa for later analysis.
- Because of the dynamic nature of the web, the manifest might not be available at the time of fetching. Run it by yourself!
